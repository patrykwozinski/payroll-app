There you can manage payrolls in your company!

## Installation
You need a `Docker` with `docker-compose`, bro! ðŸ‘Œ
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

## How to create department?
```bash
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:create-department <name> <bonus type> <bonus value>
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:create-department "Human Resources" "yearly" 500
```
In the result should be UUID of newly created department.

## How to hire worker?
