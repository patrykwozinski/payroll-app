## Business part
### How to create department?
```bash
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:create-department <name> <bonus type> <bonus value>
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:create-department "Human Resources" "yearly" 500
```
In the result should be UUID of newly created department.

### How to hire worker?
```bash
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:hire-worker <first name> <last name> <department uuid> <salary>
docker-compose exec payroll-app bin/console payroll:hire-worker "Jon" "Snow" "91587124-1ed0-4550-af23-a7fe18acf2d3" "5000"
```
In the result should be UUID of a hired worker.
I'd like to add more types of tests.
